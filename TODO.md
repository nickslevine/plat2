json parser syntax issue. 

 The JSON parser is 99% complete but has a syntax issue with mutable generic collections
  (var elements: List<JsonValue>) that needs investigation into Plat's type system rules.

## stdlib

* pathlib
* colored printing 
* logging package  
* json, etc
* caching
* cli/tui framework
* progress bar 
* serde etc. 
* regex
* file system operations 
* pathlib. 
* random 
* time
* datetime 
* env vars
* debugging 
* sqlite 
* ffi 
* networking
  * rate limiting, backoff, etc. 
* queue, async queue. 
* parallel loops


## Tooling
Syntax Highlighting
LSP
  show argument names
  show inferred types
  show where inherited methods come from
  fuzzy method search / autocomplete? 
Debugger. 
Linting

## GC

  1. Primitive Arrays - Lists of Int32, Bool
  can also use atomic allocation (5-10% more
  gains)
  2. Incremental GC - Enable by default for
  smoother pause times
  3. Benchmark Suite - Once plat bench command
  is working, run full performance tests



  üìù Key Learning

  - Plat doesn't support blocks with multiple statements in match arms - only single expressions
  - Match patterns with early returns require careful structuring to avoid type checker confusion
